## Redefining the meaning of privacy

### The exponential increase of data transactions


As of April 2020, 59% of the world's population uses The Internet, resulting in a 33% user growth between 2014 and 2020. Additionally, the amount of generated data per minute sheds light on the scale at which communication and data exchange keep on flourishing. [In one minute](https://www.domo.com/news/press/domo-releases-eighth-annual-data-never-sleeps-infographic):
* **41,666,667**  messages exchanged by WhatsApp users.
* **319** new users on Twitter.
* **479,452** people engage with Reddit content.
* **150,000** messages were sent on Facebook.
These numbers demonstrate how much data is exchanged in one minute.

On the Internet, data privacy refers to the protection of personal data from third parties. For years companies like Google, Facebook, or Yahoo have had access to our private data and used it as means of monetization. For example, Facebook's advertising revenue made up 98% of its total revenue in 2018. When it comes to Google and Yahoo, their advertising revenue represented between 80-90% of their total income. 

### Privacy as a Human Right

> ### "The use of collected information subtly reinforces or modifies individuals' behaviors and begs the question to what extent users have control over their own decisions?"

Although these online services helped to disrupt and improve how we communicate, network, and develop ourselves, whether professionally or personally. The need to generate profit seems to have neglected the management of users' privacy and calls into question the very idea of individual freedom. According to Ithiel de Sola Pool, the Internet is a "_Technology of freedom_.". However, the ability to manage and control the disclosure of your personal information seems to be a forgotten right. <ins>1984</ins>, a dystopian novel published by George Orwell, approaches the impact of mass surveillance and having a single source of truth on people’s behaviors. In today’s society, giving in personal information without self-analysis seems to appear as the norm. Consequently, it also introduces the concept of freedom of choice as individuals should decide whether or not to share their data. Besides, the collected data aims to address the user's needs and preferences as accurately as possible without their complete awareness. Thus, **the use of collected information subtly reinforces or modifies individuals' behaviors and begs the question to what extent users have control over their own decisions**? Some could argue that George Orwell was not too far from the truth...

Online privacy tends only to offer a single and simplistic opinion; privacy is for people with bad intentions, and if one has nothing to hide, there is no need to be private. This argument throws at people a binary judgment classifying them as a good or bad person, discouraging them from the desire to access more privacy. Consequently, taking away their right to state a contradictory opinion. The saying: "_Not every bit of truth is fit to be told_." also applies to personal information. Being a transparent individual does not mean being a constant open book. For example, when communicating with someone else, everyone selects chosen thoughts within their stream of thoughts to express themselves, whether it is a positive, neutral or negative statement. This intellectual privacy and property is fundamental to preserve the comfort and freedom of choice of each of us when interacting. Additionally, if we could read everyone’s thoughts, do you think our discussions would be as genuine and authentic? Would we feel comfortable and free to imagine a contractitory opinion? Whether it is physically or online, privacy is crucial to maintain liberty and authenticity  in our way of communicating. 

### Is a monitored internet a threat to creativity and reassessment?

> ### "He who does not move, does not notice his chains."

The invisibility of the data collection and storage process and the unconscious assumption that privacy is for bad people prevent individuals from imagining alternatives to the current system.
Renowned activist and socialist Rosa Luxemburg said: "_He who does not move, does not notice his chains_.". Targeted advertisements result from "crawlers" going through your emails to provide better-personalized content to users. Although it helps people expand their product searches, it also reduces their ability to broaden their content access and explore new potential interests. Our online searches come from personal tastes, interests, and beliefs. The risk is to blind people's minds by nurturing them only with unconsciously already approved content. **Being unable to imagine concepts, ideas, or visions that differ from our personal beliefs stir us away from questioning our status quo and making use of our creativity**. Limiting people's creativity reduces their ability to think outside of the box, thus hindering their ability to reassess their rights, shared knowledge, and opportunities in their society. "_Without freedom of choice, there is no creativity_.", Benjamin Spock.

## Collected and stored data, a threat to privacy

### An understated risk

> ###   "Every 39 seconds, a cyber-attack attempt happens on the web. [...] 18,000 Solarwinds customers were compromised. [...] 5000 email servers contained web shells across 115 countries."

Online interactions generate the exchange of data which, in most cases, are stored and saved in centralized databases and servers. Although these servers and databases are highly secure, they present **2 risks**:
* The quantity of information at risk in case of a cyber-attack. Centralization gathers a sheer amount of data in one place.
* Decrypted data directly accessible to companies. It gives the opportunity to governments to use leverage against these companies to access their servers and retrieve data about its citizens without their knowledge.

During the past 18 months, two factors impacted the growth of data transactions, the expansion of Internet adoption and the recent COVID-19 pandemic (November 2020). Both factors disrupted society's habits by migrating from in-person to remote work (a 35% increase) and modifying purchasing and communication behaviors. Those behavioral changes have resulted in an increase in the average online time spent per day. Thus, directly impacting the total amount of stored data. Therefore, a successful attack on a targeted server represents a considerable threat for everyone having personal information on that server. Cyber-attacks have also risen since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic:
* A **150%** ransomware spike in 2020.
* **94%** of security incidents come from malware spread through emails.
* Every **39 seconds**, a cyber-attack attempt happens on the web.
Despite the technological progress in Security, recent events have proven that no system is flawless and unfailing.

#### SolarWinds
SolarWinds, a US leader in information technology, was recently the subject of a cyber-attack last year in 2020. The company relies on Orion systems to manage its IT resources (network, IT operations, security). Hackers performed a Supply Chain Attack by infecting Orion's update system using a Remote Access Trojan (RAT). The malware provided unauthorized backdoor access to the compromised system. The danger is the capacity of RATs to remain hidden, blinding Solarwinds from realizing their update servers were compromised. It took the company months before taking action to react against the cyberattack. The consequences are alarming:
* **18,000** Solarwinds customers were compromised. 
* US agencies, including Homeland security, the Pentagon, and the Treasury, were targeted.
* Fortune 500 companies such as Microsoft, Cisco, and AT&T were also vulnerable to the cyber-attack.

Additionally, the accuracy in determining the global impact and damages of a cyber-attack is often undermined. "_The size of this breach is so massive and disparate, and we are still understanding it_." declared Kiersten Todt, managing director of the Cyber Readiness Institute.

#### Microsoft Exchange 
On March 2nd, 2021, a Chinese group called Hafnium exploited four zero-day vulnerabilities to attack on-premises versions of Microsoft Exchange servers. The hackers were able to penetrate the system and created web shells to enable remote access from Microsoft servers to exfiltrate sensitive data. As for Solarwinds, the impact is tremendous:
* **5000** email servers contained web shells across **115** countries.
* Institutions such as the European Banking Authority suffered from this attack.
* Small Businesses were the object of ransomware attacks.

Despite the deployment of relevant patches by Microsoft, the damages were already done, resulting in thousands of stolen data.

### Behind the curtains

> ###   "There is a big difference between secrecy and privacy." Dick Durbin


Decrypted data stored on companies’ servers offer the opportunity for governments to collect personal information about its citizens. The absence of law and regulations regarding online privacy prevent people from deciding the extent of their data disclosure. The ability for governments to select at will personal information is an intrusion of privacy. To make a comparison to the physical world, it is similar to a restaurant customer being able to directly access the kitchen and cook his own dinner instead of having to order his food through a predetermined menu. 

In 2013, Edward Snowden released to the general public classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA). Snowden exposed government programs aiming to collect personal information and track individuals using data stored by online services. The PRISM program displays the timeline to when the data collection began for each provider. For example:
* Microsoft - September 2007
* Yahoo - December 2008
* Google - January 2009
* Facebook - March 2009
* Youtube - September 2010

Despite the willingness of these companies to put in place a lawful framework to limit the government leverage, the government can access the servers at will. The Bullrun program, named after a British civil war, has for purpose to maliciously mislead corporate partners. The NSA proclaimed to reinforce corporate partners' IT security but, in reality, built backdoors to facilitate their access to sensitive information. Additionally, the fast-growing expansion of technology considerably alleviates the ability of governmental institutions to monitor individuals. Based on the Bankston-Soltani principle: "_If the cost of the surveillance using the new technique is an order of magnitude less than the cost of the surveillance without using the new technique, then the new technique violates a reasonable expectation of privacy_." This principle aims to adjust the Fourth Amendment to adjust governments' ability to retrieve data about their citizens.

In 2018, the Cambridge Analytica story broke and revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm, harvested data from 87 million Facebook users without their consent. The company used an app called "This Is Your Digital Life", created by Aleksandr Kogan, a data scientist from the University of Cambridge. Cambridge Analytica offered Facebook users to complete a behavioral questionnaire to establish a psychological profile for academic research. Instead, the application collected personal Facebook information from respondents, including their private Facebook social connections. Politicians including Ted Cruz and Donald Trump utilized the harvested data to support their campaigns by tailoring targeted advertisements.

Breaches and government interventions demonstrate the vulnerability of our data stored online. It exposes the inability of individuals to control and manage personal information and deprives them of being the master of their online fate.

## Conclusion
    
Online privacy seems to have diminished for the use of comfort, the need to generate profit, and the monitoring of the masses. Even though we might feel secure while communicating from our home, the World Wide Web is far from offering the same security prerogative. **Privacy is the right of each individual to define his boundaries in which he feels safe to think, behave and evolve**. "_There is a big difference between secrecy and privacy_." Dick Durbin.

But how can we better protect ourselves and regain control over our digital life? <br></br>
