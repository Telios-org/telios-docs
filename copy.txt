### What is it?
Telios is a private email service that allows you to securely send and receieve end-to-end encrypted emails over a peer-to-peer network.
We give you complete ownership of your data by encrypting and storing it on your local devices. No 3rd party, government, or even Telios can read your unencrypted data. The only way to access your data is by using a memorized master password on your device.

### Encrypted Email
All data is encrypted with private keys generated by your local device. Those keys and all data are encrypted at rest, which means the only time your data is unencrypted
is when you locally enter your memorized master password.

### Peer to Peer
Emails sent within the Telios network are peer-to-peer, which means your data isn't required to pass through our servers.

### Backwards Compatible
You can still send and receive emails from outside the Telios network. Incoming and outgoing emails pass through our mailserver and are never stored locally. Emails received from outside the network are immediately encrypted and are never stored in plain text on our servers. Once the encrypted emails have been delivered all traces of them are removed.

### How is Telios Different?
Secure email services like Protonmail only encrypt part of your emails. In order to deliver and recieve emails, Protonmail does not encrypt email metadata like the date it was received or who its recipients are, and they also don't encrypt the subject. 
---
Telios emails by default are 100% encrypted while still allowing you to search for emails by subject, body, recipients, and attachments. 


Protonmail primarily exists as a web application which means you and Protonmail need to be online in order to access your data.
---
The Telios application allows you to still access your data without an internet connection and can still function even if our servers are offline.


Almost every online service requires a username and password for authentication. This means anyone from anywhere can attempt to login as you if they have access to your credentials.
---
Access to your Telios mailbox is only possible from your local devices and requires a memorized password to unlock. We don't store any passwords locally or on our any of our servers.


### Open Source
Our client codebase is 100% open to be viewed and scrutinized by the community. We also plan to eventually open source our server codebase for those that wish to self host.

### Cloud Storage
In the event you lose access to your device or it's somehow destroyed, we give you the option to backup your encrypted data on our servers. As long as you've remembered your master password or saved your recovery key you can recover your data from these backups.
