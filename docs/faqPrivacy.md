### What information do you store about me?
Only the name of the mailbox you created with Telios. Your recovery email gets sent to the server in plain text, but gets stored as a hash for privacy and only used for account recovery. We also maintain an email invite list that has no relationship to registered accounts.

### Does Telios store my emails?
In some cases, we will store your encrypted emails and data on our servers. Emails required to pass through our servers in plain text are never stored and are immediately encrypted. Please read the section on [how email works](email) for more information and use cases.

### Can Telios read email data?
No. Only you and the recipients can read your emails in plain text. We also went a step further and removed our ability to [see who the senders of](email#retrieval-metadata) encrypted data are.
