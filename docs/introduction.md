Telios is a private email service that allows you to securely send and receive end-to-end encrypted emails over a peer-to-peer network. We give you complete ownership of your data by encrypting and storing everything on your local devices. No third party, government, or even Telios can read your unencrypted data. The only way to access your unencrypted data is by using a memorized master password on your physical device.

The service was designed to use external servers as little as possible and know next to nothing about each user. Your devices have absolute control over how your data is shared, encrypted, and stored and will default to using the peer-to-peer network whenever possible.

At its core, Telios is built on [Hypercore Protocol](https://hypercore-protocol.org/), which allows you to share data over a peer-to-peer network without the need for a centralized server. This design means you can still send and receive emails within the network even if our servers are down, adding a layer of privacy and resiliency that does not exist with other private email providers.
