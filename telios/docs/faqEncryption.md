### Where are my keys stored?
Your private and public keys get stored on your device in a SQL Cipher database encrypted with your memorized master password. During registration, only your public keys get sent to Telios.

Account and app data are encrypted at rest on Hyperbee databases using your secret box keypair generated by your device during registration. An encrypted SQL Cipher database also stores any data that needs to be searchable by the client.
