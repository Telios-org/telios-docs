## What is it?

Telios is a private email service that allows you to securely send and receieve end-to-end encrypted emails over a peer-to-peer network.
We give you complete ownership of your data by encrypting and storing everything your local devices. No 3rd party, government, or even Telios can read your unencrypted data. The only way to access your data is by using a memorized master password on your device.
