Telios is a private email service that allows you to securely send and receieve end-to-end encrypted emails over a peer-to-peer network.
We give you complete ownership of your data by encrypting and storing everything on your local devices. No third party, government, or even Telios can read your unencrypted data. The only way to access your data is by using a memorized master password on your device.

The service was designed to use external servers as little as possible and to know next to nothing about each user. To give users complete control over their data and privacy, their personal devices have absolute control over how their data is shared, encrypted, and stored.

At it's core, Telios is built on [Hypercore Protocol](https://hypercore-protocol.org/) which allows users to share data over a peer-to-peer network without the need for a centralized server. This means users are still able to send and recieve emails within the network even if our servers are down. This design adds a layer of privacy and resiliency that does not exist with other private email providers.
